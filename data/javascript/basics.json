            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "In modern JavaScript, 'let' is preferred over 'var' for variable declarations because it has block scope."

            "code": "let x = 5;\nlet y = '5';\nconsole.log(x == y);",
            "options": ["true", "false"],
            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "The == operator performs type coercion, so it converts the number 5 to a string and then compares, resulting in true."

            "question": "What is the difference between let and var in JavaScript?",
            "code": "// What is the output of this code?\nfunction test() {\n  if (true) {\n    var x = 1;\n    let y = 2;\n  }\n  console.log(x);\n  console.log(y);\n}",
            "options": ["1, ReferenceError", "1, 2"],
            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "var has function scope, so x is accessible outside the if block. let has block scope, so y is only accessible within the if block, causing a ReferenceError when trying to access it outside."

            "question": "What is the output of this code?",

            "options": ["object", "null"],
            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "In JavaScript, typeof null returns 'object', which is considered a historical bug in the language."

            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "Array.isArray() is the correct method to check if a variable is an array. typeof arr returns 'object' for arrays, which doesn't distinguish them from other objects."
