            "question": "What is the correct way to open a file for reading in Python?",

            "options": ["with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:", "file = open('data.txt', 'read')"],
            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "The correct way to open a file is using the open() function with the file name and mode. 'r' is the mode for reading."

            "question": "What is the output of this code?",

            "options": ["Hello World", "HelloWorld"],
            "correctIndex": 1,
            "explanation": "The write() method doesn't add spaces. It writes exactly what you provide, so 'Hello' followed by ' World' becomes 'HelloWorld'."

            "question": "What is the output of this code?",

            "options": ["Line 1", "Line 1\nLine 2"],
            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "The readline() method reads a single line from the file. The strip() method removes the newline character, so only 'Line 1' is printed."
