        {
            "question": "What is the correct way to create a variable in Python?",

            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "In Python, variables are dynamically typed and don't require type declarations. You simply use the variable name, equals sign, and the value."

            "options": ["2.5", "2"],
            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "In Python 3, division of integers results in a float. So 5/2 equals 2.5."

            "explanation": "Triple quotes (''' or \"\"\") are used to create multi-line strings in Python."

            "correctIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "The condition x > 5 is True (since x is 10), so 'A' is printed. The elif block is not evaluated because the first condition was True."
